# Web-Design-Challenge
 Web-Design-Challenge Data Bootcamp

This Challenge for me was complete, I have to be honest, in some cases I was confuse because I understand I have to do the same and almost a copy of the example. And also I was not sure what information I have to be upload. Even of that I try to complete the structure about the folders and the content of the site similar as the example, and for Index I didnÂ´t change the paragraph, hope was ok.

Even the site look simple, It takes me time to complete all, also learn  how to use the Bootstrap code that was nice to know it and use it because performm all the site. I decide import direct from the page and just download the csv.

For the final It wast interesting learn new comands for the part of csv to html. Also I upload the Jupyter notebook with some comands to use convert csv to html.

This part it nice to see how looks everything.
** Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
