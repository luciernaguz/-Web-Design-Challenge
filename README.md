# Web-Design-Challenge
 Web-Design-Challenge Data Bootcamp

This Challenge for me was complete, I have to be honest, because there are some instructions were was no clear what information what have to be uploaded. Even of that I try to complete the structure about the folders and the content of the site similar as the example, and for Index I didnÂ´t change the paragraph, hope was ok.

Even the site look simple, It takes me time to complete,also lear how to use the code part of Bootstrap that was nice to know it and use it because performm all the site. I decide import direct from the page and just download the csv.
For the final It wast interesting learn new comands for the part of csv to html. Also I upload the Jupyter notebook with some comands to use convert csv to html.

This part it nice to see how looks everything.
** Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
